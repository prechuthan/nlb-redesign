This directory will contain all resources, references and ideas during the UX Research phase.

## UX Design Process
### Typical key phases
- Research - affinity mapping, defining user personas and mapping user flows
- Design - creatings wireframes and prototypes
- Testing - user testing and feedback
- Implementation - software development process

### Research
- Start with competitor research to see what's out there, before moving on to interviews with actual users of the product. 
- Identify needs, pain-points as well as opportunity for improvements. Find patterns and commonalities between the target user groups (affinity mapping).
- Create user personas to help humanize the different target user groups.
- From these personas, user flows of the path a user might take to achieve their goals can be mapped out.

### Design
- Start thinking about how the content of each page should be laid out so there is the least friction in achieving the user flows previously identified.
- Wireframes can be used to sketch out ideas first before designing more detailed prototypes.

### Testing
- Usability testing to evaluatee how intuitive and user-friendly the design is.
