This directory will contain all resources, references and ideas during the UX Research phase.

## User Experience (UX) Design Process

### Typical key phases
- Research - affinity mapping, defining user personas and mapping user flows
- Design - creatings wireframes and prototypes
- Testing - user testing and feedback
- Implementation - software development process

### Research
- Start with competitor research to see what's out there, before moving on to interviews with actual users of the product. 
- Identify needs, pain-points as well as opportunity for improvements. Find patterns and commonalities between the target user groups (affinity mapping).
- Create user personas to help humanize the different target user groups.
- From these personas, user flows of the path a user might take to achieve their goals can be mapped out.

### Design
- Start thinking about how the content of each page should be laid out so there is the least friction in achieving the user flows previously identified.
- Wireframes can be used to sketch out ideas first before designing more detailed prototypes.

### Testing
- Usability testing to evaluatee how intuitive and user-friendly the design is.

### Implementation
- Working togther with software engineers to ensure the the design is technically feasible.

## User Interface (UI) Design

UI should be as simple and efficient as possible, with a perfect combination of techincal fuctionality and asthetic looks.

### Steps to keep in mind
- Keep things simple - be clear in the language used in labels (common words are easier to understand)
- Take advantage of commonly used UI elements - no need to reinvent the wheel
- Help options - tooltips, help buttons are useful as a last resort
- Create a pattern in design - be consistent with design, language and layout
- Use colour, texture and typography to your advantage - use them to draw attention to specifc content, create hierarchy and increase readability
